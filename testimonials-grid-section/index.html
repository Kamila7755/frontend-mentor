				<p class="testimonials__short-review">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects learned were current,
					if
					not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
				<p class="testimonials__long-review">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been
					looking
					to
					make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here, I signed up for the free
					intro
					course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best- and most
					gruelling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a
					Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

				<p class="testimonials__short-review">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
				<p class="testimonials__long-review">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed
					some
					structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step, I was encouraged to enroll by a
					former student ot theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
					did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
					project,
					in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
					have.
					In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly
					helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
